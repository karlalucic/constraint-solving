    "If you get stuck in a particular stage, you can move to the next stage and still obtain marks for that. Thus, you do not have to complete all stages perfectly to get a decent mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the limit on the number of generated solutions, in exceptional cases it could be that your model passes a stage without being fully correct, because a faulty solution was not among the generated ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can influence how many solutions are generated with the `solution_limit` argument, or by setting a solving `time_limit` in seconds. Changing the defaults to lower means faster, but less reliable, checking.\n",
    "- You can change the stages which are checked with the `stages` argument, either as e.g. `stages=2` for all stages up to and including 2, or as e.g. `stages={1,3,5}` to check only those individual stages.\n",
    "- Note: use the decision variables as-is (e.g. do not modify their `name=...` parameter, or domain), since the checker relies on those variables being in your model.\n",
    "    - However, you can (and will need to!) add new, auxiliary variables in your model. Everything will continue to work as expected.\n",
    "    - Changing the checking code in `project.py` is not advisable, as we will use the provided version in the auto-grader.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your answer is considered wrong, the checker will output a (minimal) partial assignment that is wrong.\n",
    "If you are certain that your model adheres to the spec and that the assignment should be allowed, then you can share your notebook with the teaching team so we can verify it is indeed not a mistake on our side.\n",
